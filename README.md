# goon-projects
A place to host out goon experiements.

All projects here were created for personal use. Im not really a programmer, but I'll sometimes get ideas and like to flesh em out a little. 
Everything will be provided as-is, but im always willing to humor feature suggestions!

Below is a list of the projects:

# Infini-Scroll
A single-file HTML project that sort of acts like twitter's infinite scroll, but for local content. I guess the idea is that if you have a folder of mixed-media (images, video, etc) it'll view and load them infinitely as you scroll. Its made to unload items once they're scrolled past to be less memory heavy. I tested it with a folder of 5k+ videos/images and it handled it well enough. 
Videos are muted by default but will automatically unmute once they're in view.
